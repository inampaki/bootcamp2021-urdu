# Must Create Free AWS Account

## [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

Note: For AWS Free Tier you will need a credit or debit card. The easiest way for Pakistani students is to open a bank account in Meezan Bank. Open a Meezan Aasan Account if you have no earning proof. Meezan Bank will charge Rs. 1100 for ATM Debit Card and there is a requirement of Rs. 100 minimum deposit. The card will be delivered in a few weeks. Our students have reported that this Debit card works with AWS.
